# how it works
Everything here is done completely from scratch.

I used React to build the page and tested the codes functionality with Jest & Enzyme.

The product page is made up of 10 different stateful components for each product.

When you click on a products picture, a modal will pop up with an image related to the selected product.

If there is any more related pictures to the product, you can scroll through them with buttons on the sides of the modal, otherwise click on the image or press any key to exit the modal.
