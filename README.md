# how it works
The product page is made up of 10 different stateful components for each product.

When you click on a products picture a modal will pop up with an image related to the selected product.

If there is any more related pictures you can scroll through them with buttons on the sides of the modal, otherwise click on the image to exit the modal (pretty self explanitory).
